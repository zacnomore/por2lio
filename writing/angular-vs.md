import Layout from "../../components/Layout";

As a tool, Jira provides a rather intuitive approach to project management. Work is tasks, the complexity is often the relationships they have to each other.

When used in a feature-oriented manner, it is largely comprehensible to users what kind of work is happening. Many consider

export default ({ children }) => (
  <Layout reading="true" title="Fun">
    {children}
  </Layout>
);
