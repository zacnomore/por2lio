[The supreme court is currently deciding a case regarding a website designer who doesn't want to make websites for gay couples.](https://www.npr.org/2022/12/05/1140824371/supreme-court-gay-marriage-colorado) One of the concerns for the case that caught my eye was whether websites should be considered art.

Ultimately, as someone that spends their days in front of this screen trying to think up new and interesting ways to layout text and images, I sure like to imagine that there is actually a degree of artistry here. As far as frontend developers go, I'm more on the JavaScripty side of things but I find beauty in code all the time. A simple and clear solution to a problem is thought provoking and inspiring. If that doesn't sound like art, I'm not sure what would! 

I believe we should be bringing _more_ artistry to the web. The most radical departure to art we see in the web is how diffuse the control is. Websites aren't movies, there's no director to guide the show. If we consider a spectrum spanning between pure craftsmanship and pure artistry mediated by the degree of decision-making of that individual. Those furthest reaches are hard to find, a painting exihibit small but real limitations in the decision-making such as cost and practicalities of the material. On the other end, we could imagine a furniture-maker may have specifications to follow but the details of their carving or fabric choices could represent a level of artistry. Websites seem an awful lot closer to furniture, don't they?

All that space in the middle is what I'd call corporate art. I think our workplaces are sufferring from a highly functionally-oriented approach to this art. In the web, you might look at the high degree of fashionality in design and think otherwise but this rapid trend cycle is just a means to differentiate new sites from their legacy bretheren. There's no artistic purpose in looking like every other new site. Choosing to look like everyone else isn't much of a choice at all.

That's really a landing page game anyways. When we start looking at the enterprise level, things get pretty dismal. The _experience_ is not remotely important. In fact, the pitch for these products is a laundry list of features. Even when the customer isn't paying for the site itself that's what the conversation revolves around. I can say from experience that eCommerce development is not a question of how to make a pleasant shopping experience but an *effective* one. And that is defined by all the ways that we cross-sell, up-sell, increase average order value, attribute sales, convert...

Part of what we're experiencing here is the division of labor. It's certainly efficient at breaking down the work but what we're losing is the auteur approach. A big-picture view is afforded to the director of IT but their artistic vision is diluted and corrupted through a branching game of telephone as instructions filter down the org chart. How can we get our IT director to work more like a movie director?

- Creative director in tandem with "producer" IT Director 
- CTA - give instructions like an artist (communicate intention)
